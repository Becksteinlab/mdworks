## mdworks: molecular dynamics, with Fireworks!

``mdworks`` is a package for building fire-and-forget automated workflows for
performing molecular dynamics simulation using
[Fireworks](http://pythonhosted.org/FireWorks/). It implements both
general-purpose and engine-specific building blocks, making it easy to build
common workflows and simple enough to construct more complex ones.

In addition to basic building blocks, we hope to include implementations of
workflows that encode complex simulation schemes, especially enhanced-sampling
methods that require many simulations to progress.

This is very much a pre-alpha package. It is not API stable. Please use the issue
tracker for discussion, bug reports, and requests.
